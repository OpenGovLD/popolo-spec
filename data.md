<h1 id="scope">Scope</h1>

The data standard's initial scope is to describe the entities below and the relations between them:

<dl>
  <dt>Person</dt>
  <dd>A real <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person">person</a>, alive or dead</a></dd>
  <dt>Organization</dt>
  <dd>Use the W3C Organization ontology's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/#org:Organization">definition</a></dd>
  <dt>Address</dt>
  <dd>A physical location or a mail delivery point</dd>
  <dt>Post</dt>
  <dd>Use the W3C Organization ontology's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/#org:Post">definition</a></dd>
  <!--dt>Area</dt>
  <dd>A bounded area, like an administrative boundary</dd-->
</dl>

The data standard will initially define two serializations: a <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> and a MongoDB schema.

<h1 id="use-cases-and-requirements">Use Cases &amp; Requirements</h1>

The data standard is designed primarily for open government use cases, though other use cases are supported. The data standard defines classes and properties to fulfill the requirements below.

1. Allow the use of imprecise dates [*[7]*](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo-standard/issues/7).

## Person

The Person class should have properties for:

1. name

    >Mr. John Q. Public, Esq.

1. each component of the name (given names, family names, additional names, prefixes and suffixes)

    >To sort a list of representatives by family name, or to display an abbreviated name on a mobile device.

1. former names

<h2 id="relations">Relations</h2>

[No one size fits all](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/#reporting_structure) in representing the relationship between people and organizations. In some cases, a simple binary relation is enough, e.g. a `memberOf` property that links a person to an organization. In other cases, a complex [n-ary relation](http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/) is required, e.g. to describe the duration of the person's membership; in such cases, we create a new class to represent the relation, e.g. a Membership class, and attach properties like duration to it to describe the relationship between the person and the organization.

In some cases, it is relevant to represent the organizational structure independently of the people within that structure; for example, it is relevant to represent the position of the Member of Parliament for Avalon even when no one holds that position. A *Post* is such a position that exists independently of the person holding it.

A Post should not be confused with a *Role*, which describes a function that a person can fulfill in an organization. For example, people in different organizations can all fulfill the Role of CEO, but only one person can hold the Post of CEO at Apple Inc. Indeed, the Post of the MP for Avalon could be described as having the role of MP.

The Membership and Post classes cannot be united. Let John Doe be an MP in the House of Commons. If using the Membership class to represent this relationship, then when John Doe leaves office, we would destroy the Membership instance connecting John Doe to the House of Commons â€“ or set an `endDate` property to flag the Membership as historical. If using the Post class, then when John Doe leaves office, we would unset a `heldBy` property on the Post instance, which was previously set to John Doe[<sup>1</sup>](#note1). The Post would remain.

Now let John Doe be a member of the XYZ Party. It only makes sense to use the Membership class. If John Doe leaves the party, the instance used to describe his relationship to the party should not remain; the instance should either be destroyed or archived.

Some use cases may therefore require both Post and Membership classes to satisfy their requirements. It may be a best practice in implementations to use a Membership class until a strong use case emerges for a Post class.

The Post class should have properties for:

* the person who holds the post
* the organization in which the post is held
* the role that the holder of the post fulfills

The Membership class should have properties for:

* the person who is a party to the relationship
* the organization that is a party to the relationship
* the role that the person fulfills in the organization
* the time interval over which the relationship exists

<p class="note" id="note1">1. A Post instance cannot represent historical holders of the position, given that a Post survives all its holders. To represent such historical information, a Membership instance can be used. If a Post ceases to exist, a Post instance can of course be used to represent that historical position.</p>

<h1 id="standard-reuse">Standard Reuse</h1>

This project should adopt suitable existing standards wherever possible. Following [a survey](data/survey.html), these are:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Publisher</th>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Prefix</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><abbr title="Internet Engineering Task Force">IETF</abbr></td>
      <td><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350">vCard 4.0</a></td>
      <td><code>vcard</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td><a href="http://vocab.org/bio/0.1/.html">BIO vocabulary</a></td>
      <td><code>bio</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Briefly, the survey concludes that, with respect to the Person class:

* No vocabulary has a property for former names, except for `person:birthName`.
* No vocabulary describes biographies without importing the BIO vocabulary, except for `facebook:bio`.
* vCard is the only vocabulary to meet all other requirements.

For the Organization class:

* No vocabulary has a property for former dates.
* No vocabulary has a property for dissolution dates, except for `vcard:deathDate`.
* The Organization ontology is the only vocabulary to meet all other requirements.

For the Address class, vCard is the only vocabulary to meet all requirements. In terms of relations, only the Organization ontology offers multiple ways to describe the relation between people and organizations.
