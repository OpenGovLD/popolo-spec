<h2 id="relations">Relations</h2>

[No one size fits all](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/#reporting_structure) in representing the relationship between people and organizations. In some cases, a simple binary relation is enough, e.g. a `memberOf` property that links a person to an organization. In other cases, a complex [n-ary relation](http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-n-aryRelations/) is required, e.g. to describe the duration of the person's membership; in such cases, we create a new class to represent the relation, e.g. a Membership class, and attach properties like duration to it to describe the relationship between the person and the organization.

In some cases, it is relevant to represent the organizational structure independently of the people within that structure; for example, it is relevant to represent the position of the Member of Parliament for Avalon even when no one holds that position. A *Post* is such a position that exists independently of the person holding it.

A Post should not be confused with a *Role*, which describes a function that a person can fulfill. For example, people in different organizations can all fulfill the Role of CEO, but only one person can hold the Post of CEO at Apple Inc. Indeed, the Post of the MP for Avalon could be described as having the Role of MP.

The Membership and Post classes can't be merged. John Doe is an MP in the House of Commons. If using the Membership class to represent this relationship, then when John Doe leaves office, we would destroy the Membership instance connecting John Doe to the House of Commons â€“ or set an `endDate` property to flag the Membership as historical. If using the Post class, then when John Doe leaves office, we would unset a `heldBy` property on the Post instance, which was previously set to John Doe[<sup>1</sup>](#note1). The Post would remain.

Now let John Doe be a member of the XYZ Party. It only makes sense to use the Membership class. If John Doe leaves the party, the instance used to describe his relationship to the party should not remain; the instance should either be destroyed or archived.

Given that a Membership and a Post behave differently in the same situation, like a person leaving office, and given that only one or the other behavior is appropriate in some cases, like party membership, a single class cannot express both Membership- and Post-style behaviors.

Some use cases may therefore require both Post and Membership classes to satisfy their requirements.

<p class="note" id="note1">1. A Post instance cannot represent historical holders of the position, given that a Post survives all its holders. To represent such historical information, a Membership instance can be used. If a Post ceases to exist, a Post instance can of course be used to represent that historical position; it just can't represent all historical holders of that position.</p>
