  <h1>The Popolo Standard</h1>
</div>

This project's motivation is to make it easier for civic developers to create government transparency, monitoring and engagement websites.

The project's core parts are:

* a [data standard](data.html)
* an [API specification](api.html) *(coming soon)*
* a [reference implementation](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo)

These documents are **Working Drafts**. Their governance will follow a simplified [W3C process](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/).
