  <h1>The Popolo Project</h1>
</div>

This project's motivation is to make it easier for civic developers to create government transparency, monitoring and engagement websites.

The project's core parts are:

* a [data specification](data.html)
* an [API specification](api.html) *(coming soon)*
* a [reference implementation](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo)

These documents are **Working Drafts**. Their governance will follow a simplified [W3C process](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/).

* Join the [W3C Open Government Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/opengov/) and [subscribe to its mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-opengov/) to discuss the project's development
* Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo-standard/tree/gh-pages), discuss [open issues](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo-standard/issues) and consult the [wiki](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo-standard/wiki/Data-standard-wiki)
