  <h1>The Popolo Project</h1>
</div>

This project's goal is to author, through community consensus, international open government data specifications relating to the legislative branch, so that the open government sector can spend less time transforming data and more time applying it to the problems they face. A related goal is to make it easier for civic developers to create government transparency, monitoring and engagement websites, by developing reusable open source components that implement the specifications.

The project's core parts are:

* a [data specification](data.html)
* an [API specification](api.html) *(coming soon)*
* a [reference implementation](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo)

These documents are **Working Drafts**. Their governance will follow a simplified [W3C process](http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/).

* Join the [W3C Open Government Community Group](http://www.w3.org/community/opengov/) and [subscribe to its mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-opengov/) to discuss the project's development
* Visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo-standard/tree/gh-pages), discuss [open issues](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo-standard/issues) and consult the [wiki](https://github.com/opennorth/popolo-standard/wiki/Data-standard-wiki)
